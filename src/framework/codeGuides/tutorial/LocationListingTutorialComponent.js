          <p> It is important to understand why you are using a new technology, and this requires understanding your 
          goal. One should not be writing code or installing a framework without this understanding. Unless the goal is
           something specific to yourself such as learning a JavaScript component framework, then you should also
           spend time talking to potential users.</p>
                   
         <p>For example, I decided to create a location listing component using a map after a Strong Towns DMV 
         discussion about community bulletin boards. We were talking about locations for bulletin boards to post event 
         information, and there wasn't an existing source of information.</p>
         
         <p>On the other hand, there are instances where places.js or another web-based solution isn't useful. I
         considered using places.js to create a simple timer application that could help mindful breathing with on
         a consistent interval. However, I came to the conclusion that it is better to learn in person from someone
         who is experienced with mindful breathing, or self-learn, and then breathe mindfully without using any 
         electronics. Using an online timer involves an extra step, and it can lead to being distracted from mindfulness
         by Internet browsing. </p>
